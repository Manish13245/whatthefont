            <h2>As It Was - Harry Styles</h2>
            <p class="verse">Holdin' me back<br>Gravity's holdin' me back<br>I want you to hold out the palm of your hand<br>Why don't we leave it at that?</p>
            <p class="volume">Nothin' to say<br>When everything gets in the way<br>Seems you cannot be replaced<br>And I'm the one who will stay, oh</p>
            <p class="chorus">In this world, it's just us<br>You know it's not the same as it was<br>In this world, it's just us<br>You know it's not the same as it was<br>As it was, as it was<br>You know it's not the same</p>
            <p class="verse">Answer the phone<br>Harry, you're no good alone<br>Why are you sitting at home on the floor?<br>What kind of pills are you on?</p>
            <p class="volume">Ringin' the bell<br>And nobody's coming to help<br>Your daddy lives by himself<br>He just wants to know that you're well, oh</p>
            <p class="chorus">In this world, it's just us<br>You know it's not the same as it was<br>In this world, it's just us<br>You know it's not the same as it was<br>As it was, as it was<br>You know it's not the same</p>
            <p class="verse">Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet <br>I don't wanna talk about the way that it was <br>Leave America, two kids follow her <br>I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first</p>
            <p class="volume">Hey <br>As it was <br>You know it's not the same as it was <br>As it was, as it was</p>    
            <p class="bridge">The END!!!</p>
